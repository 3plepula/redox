RED</a></h2>  
        <p>Fulfilling what our hearts desire is what we have always wanted since the beginning.
            Way back on July 18, 2005, Triple Cajote Red was born. He was raised by his mother together with his two sisters, who are named Charity and Divina Red. Time passed, and he learned and discovered a lot of new things, especially what he had seen and adapted to in his surroundings. He didn't even notice that he had talents like singing, playing instruments, or playing online games. And yet, he also finds joy and comfort in listening to music and watching movies. During his childhood days, he developed his skills in soccer and basketball. And now, in his present life, he has gained a lot of knowledge and understanding from every perspective in life. He is now a college student currently studying at Blancia Carreon Foundation and Incorporated, also known as BCFI, in Molave, Zamboanga del Sur. And yet, despite the fact that he didn't pursue his dream course, which is to study medicine, he never quit life and pursued one of his optional courses, which is computer science.
            This man aims for nothing but to pay for all the hardships and sacrifices her mother made for him. In short, the only golden dream he had was to be successful someday and make his family, especially his mother, proud.</p>

            <p> They say a family is built with a father, mother, and children. But the world is sometimes unfair since not all people are given a chance to have this so-called "family" complete.
                A young man was born and raised by a single mother without the tender touch of his father. He was from a broken family, and yet he does sometimes seek his father's love, but the love from his mother and his family contented him. He was grown without the shortcomings of his family. From discipline, life advice, guidance and understanding, and many more. This family had never left his side, even in the darkest phase of his life. This gives him the light and hope that will hold his hands together to stand up.
                People may tend to leave us at the end of the day, but your family will forever remain. That's how family gives us the importance and commitment we surely deserve.</p>

            <p>In today's generation, it's rare to find someone who will be there for you through ups and downs. A friend that you can count on even when the world turns you around and neglects you
                A man with an empty heart is looking for people who can fill it. At first, he was having a hard time looking for it, but then suddenly, what he was looking for came into his life without his notice. The uncountable laughter they shared, the lame jokes they've exchanged, and lastly, the unforgettable bonds they feel upon this kind of friendship he was looking for made him the best version of himself. Even though they will be apart, the connections they build will forever remain in their hearts.
                This kind of friendship is not just for the fun part of the story; it will also be the greatest plot twist in his life. True friends will always remain the same.</p>

            Success is the sweetest word we can have, especially if we put effort and dedication into aiming for it.
On July 7, 2023, one of the most unforgettable dates for STEM Eagles at Tambulig National High School was marked as one of the biggest challenges they've faced in their senior high school days. It was the day of 3I's and Capstone's final defense. Students were rushing and feeling trembling while trying to master and practice their speech in front of everybody. Where worriedness was painted on their faces, the pressure of the feeling affected how the audiences and panelists looked at them. And yet, this was overcome by a man who's never brought anything but faith in God and bravery. He stood in front of everyone and defended his study on his own without the others' help. It took a lot of courage for him to succeed. Yet he did not fail; this man successfully achieved his goal, which is to defend his research problem.
This day will be forever unforgettable and markable to him since that day was the beginning of his new journey as a new product from his alma mater in college.</article>

                <article><p>Title: "Beside" you</p>
                    Love isn’t always easy. And sometimes, even when two people want to be together, it seems as though life has a fantastic knack for throwing obstacles in our way to prevent us from having an easy shot at romance.
                    On April 21, 2023, the song "Beside You" by Keshi was released.
                    Vietnamese American alt-pop and R&amp;B artist Casey Luong—better known by his stage name Keshi—just released his first single entitled “Beside You" on April 23, 2021. The track, produced in collaboration with French artist Madeon, is unabashedly vulnerable—naked, even, in several senses of the word: the track’s wistful sensuality is an easily recognizable signature of Keshi’s sad boy narrative. This track is preceded by the release of Keshi’s 2020 EP and is the first new original after a brief six-month hiatus. The song was about moving on from and leaving someone who never made the protagonist feel right. Keshi is offering to be by the protagonist’s side if the protagonist is ready to let go and move on. The chorus has Keshi singing, “Don’t lie, baby, don’t lie. His love never felt right. Switch sides, and I’m beside you. If you say it’s alright,” signifying that the singer is offering to be the one to fill that void and create a more genuine, sincere relationship.
                    As of now, the singer already has hits, and they've already racked up over 17 million streams on Spotify to date.
                        
                    <p>Title: "television/so far so good";</p>
                    <p> Rex Orange County is an English singer-songwriter known for his unique blend of indie pop and R&amp;B. One of his most popular songs, “Television/So Far So Good,” carries a deeper meaning that resonates with many listeners. The song delves into themes of introspection, self-realization, and the complexities of modern relationships.

                            At its core, “Television/So Far So Good” explores the struggle between experiencing life authentically versus being influenced by the superficial realm of television and popular culture. It highlights the conflict between living in the present moment versus escaping into a world of distractions and illusions. The inspiration for the song stemmed from Rex Orange County’s personal experiences and observations of how people willingly lose themselves in the world of television and popular culture. He saw a generation that derives its sense of identity, happiness, and self-worth from the superficial world of screens and feeds. This line emphasizes how some individuals seek love, validation, and a sense of belonging through television and popular culture. It criticizes the way people use these distractions as a substitute for genuine connections, relationships, and personal growth.</p>

                                <article>The Expendables 2 is a 2012 American action film directed by Simon West, written by Richard Wenk and Sylvester Stallone and based on a story by Ken Kaufman, David Agosto and Wenk. Brian Tyler returned to score the film. It is the sequel to The Expendables (2010), and is the second installment in The Expendables film series. The film stars an ensemble cast of largely action film actors consisting of Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Liam Hemsworth, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the film, The Expendables undertakes a mission which evolves into a quest for revenge against rival mercenary Jean Vilain, who murders one of their own men and threatens the world with a deadly weapon.
        
                                    Principal photography took place over 14 weeks (beginning in September 2011) on an estimated $100 million budget. Film locations included Bulgaria, Hong Kong and New Orleans. Controversy arose over the accidental death of a stuntman and environmental damage caused during filming in Bulgaria.
                                    
                                    The film was released in Europe on 16 August 2012, and in North America the following day. The Expendables 2 grossed over $310 million worldwide, with its greatest success outside North America. Critics generally considered the film an improvement over its predecessor due to its increased use of humor and action sequences, but its plot and dialogues received criticism. A tie-in downloadable video game was released on 31 July 2012 as a prequel to the events of the film. A sequel titled The Expendables 3 was released on 15 August 2014.</article>
